"""Pure-NumPy synthetic downscaling item generator for the Ray Data ingest path.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the torch._C worker bug, correctly diagnosed):
  The --ingest ray path runs a flat_map UDF in Ray Data worker processes. The
  earlier UDF did ``from pcrf.data import SyntheticDownscaleDataset``, and
  pcrf/data.py imports torch at module top. Importing torch inside a Ray Data
  worker (a process the raylet forks/spawns) intermittently fails with

      NameError: name '_C' is not defined        # torch/__init__.py: for __name in dir(_C)

  i.e. torch's compiled _C extension is not initialized in that worker process.
  The root cause was NOT a torch tensor crossing the Arrow boundary (the earlier
  theory baked into the old docstrings); it was ``import torch`` ITSELF failing
  in the worker. The robust, deterministic fix is to keep the whole UDF
  torch-free so no Ray Data worker ever imports torch. This module therefore has
  NO torch import on purpose -- numpy only.

The arrays mirror SyntheticDownscaleDataset (pcrf.data) in STRUCTURE -- a
divergence-free wind from a smoothed stream function, non-negative precip blobs,
a block-mean coarse conditioning field, and smooth "satellite" bands -- but the
RNG and the coarse upsampling differ from the torch dataset (numpy Generator vs
torch.Generator; nearest-block upsample vs bicubic). That is intentional and
harmless: ``--ingest ray`` is a data-ingest / throughput path exercised on
SYNTHETIC data, not a fidelity comparison against the torch dataloader, so
bit-identical fields are neither needed nor claimed. Channel order of "fine" is
[precip, u, v] (physics.ChannelSpec(0, 1, 2)), matching the torch dataset and
core.training_loss.
