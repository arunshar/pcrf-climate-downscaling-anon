"""
Rectified-flow training and sampling for PC-RF (Section 3.1-3.2 of the paper).

Training objective (Eq. 6):
    L = L_RF + lambda1 L_div + lambda2 L_nn + lambda3 L_mass

The physics penalties are evaluated on the one-step clean-field estimate
    x_hat = x_t + (1 - t) * v_theta(x_t, t, c)
which is the rectified-flow analogue of the predicted data point.
